## ipn_donate_menu
###  IPN PayPal Donate Menu v1.0 by Klutsh

The IPN PayPal Donate Menu Plugin allows you to quickly and easily setup a PayPal donation button on your website.

This version I started after deciding to set a Donators class on my site, and got fed up doing it all by hand.

Based on PayPal Donate Menu 1.3 by whoisrich, I have added IPN notification.

A New MySQL table is used to log all transactions, and as it is the IPN script updates signed-in users to the class with ID 2.

Option to display the Total of the Recoreded donations.

I have also added SandBox mode to allow you to play about with it should you want.

###  PayPal Donate Menu v1.3 by Richard Perry 

Description: The PayPal Donate Menu Plugin allows you to quickly and easily setup a PayPal donation button on your website.

Author credit: Richard Perry

This version I started after my PayPal email address was being harvested and started getting lots of spam.

Based on PayPal Donate Menu 1.2 by Cam and Bazzer, I have added light protection, designed to mask the PayPal email without causing hassle to any donors.

I also took the opportunity to go through all the code, updating, tidying and fixing a few things.

If you want to try it out, feel free to make a donation at GreyCube.com

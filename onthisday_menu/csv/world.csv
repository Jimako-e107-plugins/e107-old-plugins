In discussing the preparations for the formal surrender ceremony, scheduled for September 2nd, he said: The surrender plan has been going splendidly. There is every indication that the occupation will continue without bloodshed or friction. The American occupation is continuing at a rate of 300 troop planes per day. While on the same day the remaining Japanese troops formally surrender in the Philippines, and the Japanese Marcus Island garrison surrenders to American Admiral Whiting."
"Known in Germany as the Polish Campaign, World War","1939-9-1","Known in Germany as the Polish Campaign, World War II begins with the invasion of Poland by the armies of Germany, the Soviet Union, and a small contingent of Slovak forces one week after the signing of the secret Hitler-Stalin Pact. Three German Army Groups begin the Invasion of Poland at 4:45am. Massive strikes by the Luftwaffe destroy vital communications and assembly areas, decimating the Polish air force on the ground. Panzer and motorized divisions make deep penetrations into the Polish defenses, using tactics soon to be known as the Blitzkrieg. Officially, the first shots of the World War II are fired from the 280mm deck guns of the vintage First World War Battleship Schleswig-Holstein. Under the guise of honouring the anniversary of the Battle of Tannenburg, the German Battleship, complete with a hidden cargo of Marine assault troops, was allowed by the Poles to anchor directly off the strategic island of Westerplatte, located at the mouth of the Vistula River in Danzig. At 4:47am, permission was given to the ship to open fire on the island, a strategic point on the Baltic Coast needed to support the troops advancing to the south. Shortly after 4:47am, the ship opened up its massive main guns, firing at near-point-blank range and zero elevation. Needless-to-say, the shells literally pounded the small island, but although the ships' guns devastated the target, they inflicted minimal casualties on the Poles stationed within. When the Assault Marines hidden within the Battleship disembarked and launched their main assault on the island, they were repulsed taking heavy casualties. Another assault was launched later in the morning the Assault Marines after more shelling from the Schleswig-Holstein, but this also ended in heavy German casualties. The Westerplatte would prove impossible to take on the first day of World War II. Lieutenant Wladyslaw Gnys of 2 Krakow Air Regiment shoots down two Dornier 17 Bombers. These were to be the first German airplanes to be shot down in World War II. France and the United Kingdom honored their defensive alliance of March 1939 by declaring war two days later."

Launched from Wassenaar, a suburb of The Hague still in German hands, the first V-2 rocket to land in England reaches Chiswick in west London. At this point the threat from the V-1 has been chiefly removed by the capture of the launch sites in France, but now the new projectile, fired from mobile launchers, poses a new problem. Its 192-mile flight is completed in five minutes and destroys six houses, with three people killed and ten injured. This was not the intended target, of course, but those witnessing the event cannot explain the cause of the explosion because the speed of the projectile is such that it arrives before the sound of its passage is heard. Press statements are minimal and the public remains in the dark for two months. The Allies will find it difficult to fly raids against the mobile launch vehicles even though they quickly trace the area in which they are operating. The V-2 programm will have a minimal efect on the war as a whole, the daily bombardment barely equalling the effect of a single Allied bomber over Germany."

Howe decided to attempt to outflank Washington and sent 5,000 troops under Lieutenant-General Wilhelm von Knyphausen to feint against Washington's centre while another force under Cornwallis was sent on a flanking move around the American right. A combination of the late hour, the tiredness of Cornwallis' troops and the British lack of cavalry allowed the American forces  to withdraw in unexpectedly good order. Despite this, Brandywine was a major British victory. Howe suffered 576 casualties, compared to 900 American. The British also captured most of the American artillery and 100 prisoners.

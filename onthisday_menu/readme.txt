Introduction
This is a simple “On This Day” plugin.  A menu can be displayed showing events which occurred on this particular day.  A link is produced which enables the full page to be displayed with all the extended information.  Supports BBCode and, if enabled, HTML wysiwyg text editing area.  It comes with a couple of sample csv files to populate the table.

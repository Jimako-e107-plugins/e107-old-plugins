- ffa match report form:
. need to add forfeit/draw.
. need to be able to edit ranks if match scheduled report.
- Match info should display something about forfeit/draw
- double check draw for glicko2. looks ok.
- in match report forms, replace disabled nputs by text/hidden inputs.
- replace add/remove team/player by textbox with number
<input type="number" min="2" max="20" step="2" />
- 	MyTeam (Not ranked)
- not logged in, report match button appears.

. if event is draft, popup to tell event manager to activate.
. match report form. if match is scheduled, server needs to check that player list is correct.
 In general, do not trust user input, the can submit a modified form.
. Better match info for 1v1
. Add to stats: "activity"
 Measure of activity could be:
  - high glicko sigma = low activity (sigma0=350, lowers when you play, increases when you don't)
  - gain an acivity point if you play in the rating period, and loose one if you don't
  - ?
  - decay/bonus
. Winner/loser report 1v1: prefill player 1 and result. Only need to choose player 2
. like division/gamer, change events.php to have game_id icon

. (resolved) max_num_players_reached -> for ladder -> hard limit, for tourny -> wait list.

3/23/2014
. (resolved) adding a player to a bracket after tournament starts is a problem.
A player who previously add a bye will not
There will be a match too many.

2/27/2014
. (resolved) kick_team does not erase matchs.
. (resolved) can't replace "empty" seed.
. (resolved) remove pagination for players_list in eventmanage, not working with player replace/shuffle...

.IMPORTANT
 if fixtures_enabled=1 && status='active', we can not re-order the seeds, because it would screw up the bracket.
-> Prevent "quit"/"kick"
-> if 'checkin_enabled' and 1 seeded player has not checked in?

. tournament, checkin enabled, if no one has checked in, the brackets shows a ";"

. ban/kick/del_games/del_awards for teams
 - team banned -> need all players banned.
 - if player joins a banned team, it should be banned too.
  - jointeamevent: event->eventAddPlayer(team) -> not allowed if team banned.
  - division->addMember()
 - show checked in players/teams in ladders?
  - banned teams/players should not appear in players list in report match dialog.
. automatic checkin if log after checkin starts?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Match report in dialog.
- matchscheduledreport -> check if match exists.

. fix?: if we lower the max number of players, what do we do if number_players>max_number_players
 1: can only happen if event is not started yet. after that, the button is disabled
    So the only issue is with non-fixtures events, during signup, where we do not allow more than max_players
. add "player substitution" for fixtured (if no game played yet by the user we want to replace)
. Event admin "Add" non-gamers?
. Notification for deleted players?
. Add "forfeit" button for non-accepted challenges (or accepted, but not played?)
 - active matches
 - pending matches (need approval)
 - scheduled matches
 - challenges requested (not yet confirmed/accepted)
 Need to find which case
. "checkin" only makes sense for fixtured events?
. add platforms to game
. add "game" page, with events for each game
. matchinfo.php should use Match object!
. probably would be better to recalculate the brackets every time, rather than when schedulematch is true?
. seeding/page split not correct.
. gamer profile should have a "game" selector

Stats per game:
1. what if i want to reset the stats at some point.
2. what if i want to have stats for a period of time (season...)
3. do I want to count stats for every event, or only "Official"
4. Add new field to events, called "Category"?
   So we can get stats for all the events falling in that category?
   this category needs to link to a list of categories set in the admin page?
   categorie could contain 
    . unique id
    . text field (tags)
	. date range (season)

DONE
. late checkins instead of late signups when checkin is enabled?
it looks like signups not checked in are kicked 
. delete match in bracket if event over -> change status (finished -> active) / remove rewards?
. Prevent "quit"/"kick" if fixturesenabled=1 && status='active', because deleting a player re-orders the seeds, which screws up the bracket.
. event option: allow late signup (enable/disable)
  - for fixtured, it will be disabled once 1 game is played
. event option: enable/disable signup (prevent users from signing up)
. Bug: edit match in fixtured event deletes it and creates new one, but there is a mismatch with the bracket results.

. Fixtures
 . disable challenges if fixtures are enabled

. Teams
 . need team quit event.
 . need team checkin, kick, ban in event manage page
 . delete teams should delete matches, scores, awards, ...

. Deleted items
 . Bug: when displaying an item, we should verify it is in database
  - claninfo,
  - clanmanage,
  - eventinfo,
  - eventmanage
  - matchinfo (says match deleted)

. Verify every database access.
 Check the return value, use check_qd_query()?

. Form process redirect
 - if item created -> show that item
 - if item deleted: show a page saying "item deleted", and a link to redirect
 - if can not do something: show a page saying "could not do this because...", and a link to redirect
  . clandelete (if scores>0)

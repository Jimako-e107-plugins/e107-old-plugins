This Plugin was originally introduced by Marc Peppler.<br>
His last release was version 1.2<br>
I have since expanded and updated the code, since it was no longer compatible with e107.<br>
The information below and the donation link is still from Marc Peppler's release of version 1.2<br>
I have left it in place for the time being, so he can receive recognition and credit for his work.<br><br>
****************************<br><br>


<b>Thanks for your help!!</b><br><br>
Im very happy that you are using one of my e107-plugins.<br>
I have coded this plugin during my study.<br><br>
Of course this plugin is absolute <b>free</b>!! It should not bring the money or bring any riches!!<br>
But for all that it would be great if you can donate a little bit for the work that i brought into this project...<br>
So it will give me the confirmation that it was worthwhile to spend the (lot of) time into this!!<br>
(and of course it would improve the small student budget :-) )

Thank you!!

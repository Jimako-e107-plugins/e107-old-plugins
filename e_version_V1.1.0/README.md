# e_version plugin for e107 by Father Barry
original author:  http://www.keal.me.uk/


## state of the plugin
No idea. Neither from where this code is and what was changed in that 2016, but it worked with Alpha version then. 
If I had original code, I would put it to Old plugins repository.   

## future of this plugin
No idea. Some weeks ago this plugin was mentioned during discussion about how to solve the notification of plugin's update if the plugin is not posted on e107.org.  I couldn't find copy of it then.  Funny, I found it now forgotten on some old site. So I just make copy here.

Support

Support for this plug-in is ONLY available at http://www.keal.me.uk All documentation is at the e107 wiki
http://wiki.e107.org

Installation

This plugin should be installed in the usual way using the e107 plug-in manager.  It has been tested with version .7.  I can make no guarantee that it will work with any other version of e107.  

From the main configuration screen set up a maximum of 5 classes you want to assign new users to.  DO NOT have the same class in more that one class field.  For inactive fields leave them set to No One (Inactive). Do not leave the first filled as “no one” if you are using the other fields, i.e. if you are assigning users to more than one class, the first one must be set to a class in the list.
Just for Info

I use PDFCreator from  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/ as the PDF creator, a great free and comprehensive utility.

For editing I use PHP Edit from http://www.waterproof.fr/

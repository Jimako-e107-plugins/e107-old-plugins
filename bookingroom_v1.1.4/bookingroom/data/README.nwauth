Notes on MRBS with Netware Authentication                2000-01-03
-----------------------------------------
This updates and expands on the information in the AUTHENTICATION file on
how to get MRBS to authenticate to a Netware server.
This is only going to work on Linux.

There's a program called "nwauth" which is included with ncpfs. To use it
you'll need to have IPX support compiled in your kernel, and you must have
configured an IPX interface. If you can attach to Netware volumes using
ncpmount, you are all set. Otherwise, read the documentation which comes
with ncpfs.

Previous version of MRBS included the following information in
AUTHENTICATION on using Netware:
> $auth["realm"]  = "MRBS";
> $auth["type"]   = "ext";
> $auth["prog"]   = "/usr/bin/nwauth";
> $auth["params"] = "-S MYSERVER -U #USERNAME# -P #PASSWORD#";

Although the nwauth manual page describes a -P option for the password,
it does not seem to work (it is not implemente in ncpfs-2.2.0), and
this would be insecure anyway. So you cannot use "ext" (external program)
MRBS authentication.  Instead, the password must be sent through
a pipe to nwauth. (It must not be followed by return, either.) To make
this work, a new module auth_nw.inc was created.

The appropriate settings for config.inc.php are:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION

$auth["type"]   = "nw";
$auth["prog"]   = "/usr/bin/nwauth";
$auth["params"] = "MYSERVER";

Edit the above. Change the path in ["prog"] to the actual path to your
nwauth program. Change the value in ["params"] to the Netware server
name. The auth_nw.inc module does the rest.

You must also list the names of your administrator-level users in 
config.inc.php.

NOTE: nwauth must be able to find nwsfind in the PATH (which is the
web server PATH). If authentication fails, and your Apache error log
contains messages about nwsfind, try creating a link from /bin/nwsfind
to the actual path of nwsfind.

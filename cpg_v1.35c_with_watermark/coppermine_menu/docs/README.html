<h1>Coppermine Photo Gallery v1.2.0 - RC2</h1>
<p>Coppermine Photo Gallery is a picture gallery script. Users can upload pictures
  with a web browser (thumbnails are created on the fly), rate pictures, add comments
  and send e-cards. The admins can manage the galleries and batch add pictures
  that have been uploaded on the server by FTP.</p>
<p>Images are stored in albums and albums can be grouped by categories. The script
  supports multiple users and each user can possibly have its own set of albums.</p>
<p>The script also supports multiple languages and has a theme system. It uses
  PHP, a MySQL database and the GD library (version 1.x or 2.x) or ImageMagick
  to make the thumbnails. An install script makes the installation fast and simple.</p>

<a name="what"></a>
<h2>What is required</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A web server that supports PHP (the script should work with any version
    &gt;= 4.1.0)</li>
  <li>A MySQL database</li>
  <li>PHP compiled with the support for the GD library or the ImageMagick &quot;convert&quot;
    utility in order to make thumbnails and reduced size images</li>
</ul>
<a name="how"></a>
<h2>How to install the script</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Unpack the archive preserving the directory structure</li>
  <li>Uploads all files onto your webserver</li>
  <li>Run the install script on your server (http://your_server/coppermine_dir/install.php)
    and follow the instructions</li>
</ul>
<a name="getting"></a>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Login with the admin username and password, click on the &quot;admin mode&quot;
  link if it is visible, go to the <b>Config</b> page and start to configure your
  gallery. Note that even if you are a member of the administrator group, you
  need to be in &quot;admin mode&quot; to configure your gallery.</p>
<p>Use the <b>anonymous</b> group to define what non-regsitered users can and
  can't do.</p>
<p>Use the &quot;<b>Album Manager</b>&quot; (&quot;Albums&quot; link in the admin
  menu) in to create and order your albums.</p>
<p>Use the <b>properties</b> of an album to modify its description and permissions.
</p>
<p>In order for a user to be allowed to upload a picture in album two conditions
  must be met:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The user must be part of a group that can upload picture.</li>
  <li>There must be at least one album where &quot;<b>Visitors can upload pictures</b>&quot;
    has been set to &quot;<b>Yes</b>&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same apply to <b>picture rating</b> and <b>comment posting</b>.</p>
<p>If you have installed the script succesfully but are having trouble getting
  it working properly you can enable the &quot;<b>debug mode</b>&quot; on the
  <b>config page</b>. In this mode, the script outputs most of the warning/error
  messages produced by PHP in addition to some debug information. This can provide
  valuable information to understand what is wrong.</p>
<a name="changing"></a>
<h2>Changing the content of the main page</h2>
<p>On the config page, you have an option called &quot;<b>The content of the main
  page</b>&quot;. Here you can define what is displayed on the main page of the
  script.</p>
<p>The default value is &quot;<b>catlist/alblist/random,2/lastup,2</b>&quot;</p>
<p>You can use the following &quot;codes&quot;</p>
<ul>
  <li>'<b>catlist</b>': category list</li>
  <li>'<b>alblist</b>': album list</li>
  <li>'<b>random</b>': random pictures</li>
  <li>'<b>lastup</b>': last uploads</li>
  <li>'<b>topn</b>': most viewed</li>
  <li>'<b>toprated</b>': top rated</li>
  <li>'<b>lastcom</b>': last comments </li>
  <li>'<b>breadcrumb</b>': Breadcrumbs </li>
  <li>'<b>lastalb</b>': last uploaded to Albums</li>
  <li>'<b>anycontent</b>': Display contents output by anycontent.php</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The <b>,2</b> means 2 rows of thumbnails</p>
<a name="formatting"></a>
<h2>Formatting album and image descriptions</h2>
<p>Coppermine understands the following bbCodes (the same bbCodes that are used
  by phpBB) in image and album description</p>
<ul>
  <li>[b]<b>bold</b>[/b]</li>
  <li>[i]<i>italic</i>[/i]</li>
  <li>[url=http://url]<a href="javascript:;">URL text</a>[/url]</li>
  <li>[email]<a href="javascript:;">user@domain.tld</a>[/email]</li>
</ul>
<a name="xp"></a>
<h2>Using Windows XP Web Publishing Wizard with Coppermine</h2>
<p>If you are using Windows XP, you can use its built-in web publishing wizard
  to upload your photos to your gallery.</p>
<p>Once you have properly installed the script on your server, call the xp_publish.php
  file from your web browser (<a href="javascript: ;">http://your_site.com/coppermine_dir/xp_publish.php</a>).</p>
<p>The script displays some information on how to do the installation on the client
  side and how to use the Wizard. Basically you will need to download a small
  file created by the script that needs to be loaded into your Windows registry.</p>
<a name="creating"></a>
<h2>Creating your own themes</h2>
<p>Coppermine themes are stored in the &quot;<b>themes</b>&quot; directory, they
  consist of 3 files : </p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;<b>template.html</b>&quot; the main template in plain HTML.</li>
  <li>&quot;<b>style.css</b>&quot; the stylesheet associated with the template</li>
  <li>&quot;<b>theme.php</b>&quot; the PHP theme file</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new template the best solution is to use an existing one as a basis.
  Do do that make copy of the folder of the theme you want to use as a basis then
  edit the &quot;<b>template.html</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>template.php</b>&quot;
  files and replace all occurences of &quot;<b>themes/old_theme_dir</b>&quot;
  with &quot;<b>themes/new_theme_dir</b>&quot; in order for the links to point
  to the correct place.</p>
<p>When editing the &quot;<b>template.html</b>&quot; file do not remove the elements
  between <b>{}</b> these are the placeholders used by the script. Also keep in
  mind that despite this file being located in the &quot;<b>themes/your_theme_dir</b>&quot;
  directory, it must be build like if it was in the main directory of the script.
  Practically to load an image, you must use <i>&lt;img src=&quot;themes/theme_dir/images/image.gif&quot;
  alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;</i> and not <i>&lt;img src=&quot;images/image.gif&quot;
  alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;.</i> The same apply for the &quot;<b>theme.php</b>&quot;
  file.</p>
  <p>Also, make sure not to delete the line <i>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="scripts.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</i> that is needed for the full-size pop-ups and other stuff related to JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you are using an HTML editor to make your template, the best solution is
  that you copy the &quot;<b>template.html</b>&quot; file into the main directory
  of the script and edit it there. If the script find a file named &quot;<b>template.html</b>&quot;
  in the main directory it will load it instead of the one of the theme directory.
  Once you have finished your editings, move the file back to the directory of
  your theme.</p>
<p>To modify the colors, fonts, font sizes, etc... used by the script, edit the
  &quot;<b>style.css</b>&quot; stylesheet. If you want to increase or decrease
  the size of the fonts you can simply modify the line with : <i>table { font-size:
  12px; }</i>. Most of the font sizes used by the script are defined as a percentage
  of this size.</p>
<p>The &quot;<b>theme.php</b>&quot; file contains all the HTML templates used
  by the script. You can also edit them. When making modifications to these templates,
  don't touch the lines with <i>&lt;!-- BEGIN xxx --&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;!-- END
  xxx --&gt;</i>.</p>
<a name="safe"></a>
<h2>Safe mode issues</h2>
<p>A significant number of webhost on the Internet run PHP in safe mode. Coppermine
  runs without any problem in safe mode and with the &quot;open basedir restriction&quot;
  active, provided safe mode is properly configured. Unfortunately on many hosts,
  safe mode is not configured properly.</p>
<p>If your webhost is running PHP in safe mode but is misconfigured, you may need
  to do the following :</p>
<ul>
  <li>With a FTP program, change the mode of Coppermine's &quot;<b>include</b>&quot;
    directory on your server to <b>0777</b>.</li>
  <li>Do the same for the &quot;<b>albums</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>userpics</b>&quot;
    directories.</li>
  <li>Check that at the beginning the the &quot;<b>include/config.inc.php</b>&quot;
    file, you have a line with : &quot;<b>define('SILLY_SAFE_MODE', 1);</b>&quot;</li>
</ul>
<a name="smtp"></a>
<h2>Using SMTP to send emails</h2>
<p>By default the script uses the PHP built-in <b>mail</b> function to send emails.
  In some cases, the PHP built-in function can't be used.</p>
<p> If in order to send emails with PHP you need to supply a <b>hostname</b>,
  a <b>username</b> and a <b>password</b>, you need to edit the file &quot;<b>include/mailer.inc.php</b>&quot;
  and put the correct values there (<i>$CONFIG['smtp_host'] = 'smtp.somewhere.com';
  $CONFIG['smtp_username'] = 'username'; $CONFIG['smtp_password'] = 'password';</i>).
  If you don't need a username and password to connect to your SMTP server, just
  leave them blank.</p>
<p></p>
<a name="10"></a>
<h2>Upgrading from version 1.0</h2>

<p>If you already have installed version 1.0 and you want to transfer your albums
  to version 1.2 proceed in the following way:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Install version 1.2 normally in a directory different from the one where
    you installed v 1.0. Note that in order to use the upgrade script, <b>tables
    for version 1.0 and 1.2 must be stored in the same database</b>.</li>
  <li>Copy the &quot;<b>albums</b>&quot; directory of version 1.0 into the directory
    where you installed version 1.2</li>
  <li>The upgrade script assumes that you used the &quot;<b>CPG_</b>&quot; prefix
    for tables (default value) when you installed version 1.0, if this is not
    the case, edit upgrade-1.0-to-1.2.php and edit the $prefix10 variable.</li>
  <li>Login to your 1.2 Gallery, enter the admin mode</li>
  <li>Call the upgrade script, http://yousitename/coppermine_dir/upgrade-1.0-to-1.2.php</li>
  <li><b>The upgrade from 1.0 to 1.2 is a two-step process.</b> You must click the link which comes up on the bottom of the page to complete the upgrade!.</li>
        <li><b>Delete upgrade-1.0-to-1.2.php from your server</b>.
  <li>If you get an error, go to Coppermine 1.2 config page, enable debug mode,
    try to call the upgrade script again and check what errors you get.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>This upgrade process leaves your v1.0 gallery untouched </b></p>
<a name="11"></a>
<h2>Upgrading from releases of version 1.1</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>Backup your include/config.inc.php file and your "albums" directoy.</li>
                <li>Unpack the archive</li>
                <li>If the file <b>config.inc.php</b> exists in the <b>&quot;include&quot;</b> directory, delete it.</li>
                <li>If the file <b>install.php</b> exists in the root directory, delete it.</li>
                <li><b>Except for the "albums" directory</b>, upload all of the new files and directories making sure not to overwrite the include/config.inc.php file or the albums directory.</li>
                <li>Call the upgrade script http://yousitename/coppermine_dir/update.php</li>
                <li>Your upgrade should be complete.</li>
        </ul>
<a name="integrating"></a>
<h2>Integrating the script with your bulletin board</h2>
<p>Coppermine can be integrated with the following bulletin boards (eg. Coppermine
  and your bulletin board will share the same user database)</p>
<ul>
  <li>phpBB 2</li>
  <li>Invision Power Board</li>
  <li>vBulletin</li>
  <li>YaBB SE</li>
</ul>
<p>The login integration use your bulletin board cookies, therefore it won't work
  if your board cookies are not visible by Coppermine. So unless you are an expert,
  keep things simple and install Coppermine and your bulletin board on the same
  domain. Example :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bulletin board:<a href="javascript:;">http://yourdomain.com/board/</a></li>
  <li>Coppermine:<a href="javascript:;">http://yourdomain.com/gallery/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using phpBB 2, go to the admin control panel and check that &quot;Cookie
  domain&quot; corresponds to your domain, &quot;Cookie name&quot; is &quot;phpbb2mysql&quot;
  and &quot;Cookie path&quot; is &quot;/&quot;.</p>
<p>If you are using Invision Power Board, go to the &quot;admin control panel
  / board settings / cookies&quot; and check that all fields are blank. If they
  are not, you modified the default values and you are an expert.</p>
<p>If you are using vBulletin, go to the &quot;admin control panel / vBulletin
  options / HTTP Headers and output&quot; and check that the value for &quot;Cookie
  Domain&quot; corresponds to your domain and that &quot;Path to save cookies&quot;
  is &quot;/&quot;</p>
<p>It is also recommended that you use the same database for your board and Coppermine.</p>
<p>You will also need to perform the following operations after having unpacked
  the archive on your harddrive and before uploading the files to your webserver
  :</p>
<p>Edit the file <i>include/init.inc.php</i>. At the beginning of the file you
  will find the following lines :</p>
<pre>// User database integration
// Uncomment the applicable line if you want to use it
// define('UDB_INTEGRATION', 'phpbb');
// define('UDB_INTEGRATION', 'invisionboard');
// define('UDB_INTEGRATION', 'vbulletin');</pre>
<p>Un-comment the line that corresponds to the bulletin board you use (eg. remove
  the &quot;//&quot; that are at the beginning of the line)</p>
<pre>define('UDB_INTEGRATION', 'phpbb');</pre>
<p>The go to the <i>bridge</i> directory and open the file that corresponds to
  the bulletin board you use (eg. <i>phpbb.php</i>).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the file there are a number a configuration values that
  need to be set. For phpBB they are the following :</p>
<pre>// database configuration
define('PHPBB_DB_NAME','phpBB');     // The name of the database used by the board
define('PHPBB_BD_HOST','localhost'); // The name of the database server
define('PHPBB_DB_USERNAME','root');  // The username to use to connect to the    database
define('PHPBB_DB_PASSWORD','');      // The password to use to connect to the database

// The web path to your phpBB directory
// In this example http://yoursite_name.com/phpBB2/
define('PHPBB_WEB_PATH','/phpBB2/');</pre>
<p>Modify them according to the configuration of your board and save the file.</p>
<p>Upload all files onto your webserver and run the install script. Note that
  the admin username and password you enter during the installation will be ignored
  by the script. To login as an admin, you will need to use the admin username
  and password of your board.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the installation, login using the admin account of
  your board. Go to the gallery, enter admin mode and click on the &quot;Groups&quot;
  button. This will synchronize Coppermine groups with those of your board. The
  permission you will see for each group will be completely messy, so take some
  time to set them properly.</p>
<p>Each time you add or delete a group in your board you will need to do the operation
  above in order to keep the synchronisation of the groups.</p>
<p>When you will try to login / logout or manage users from Coppermine, you will
  be redirected to the corresponding page of your bulletin board. Once the login
  or logout is performed you won't be redirected automatically to the gallery
  because your board does not have any function for that. It's up to you to add
  a link on your board to get you back to the gallery.</p>
<a name="translating"></a>
<h2>Translating Coppermine into other languages</h2>
<p>Coppermine has a separate language file that make the translation of the
  script much more easy. The language files are stored in the <b>lang </b>directory.
  The files with the <b>utf-8</b> suffix are unicode encoded files. They are automatically
  generated with the <b>iconv</b> program so there is no need for you to make
  an unicode version of your translation.</p>
<p>If you select an utf-8 language file as the default one, then the script will
  be able to automatically select a language file based on the visitor browser
  configuration. For instance if the default language file is danish-utf-8 and
  an english visitor access your gallery, the english-utf-8 language file will
  be used by the script.</p>
<p> If you have translated Coppermine into a language not already supported, please visit the <a href="http://coppermine.sf.net">Coppermine Web Site</a> at Sourceforge and follow the instructions for submitting your language.</p>

This folder is not required for the Rank System and may be deleted.

Here you'll find some additional files that you may use to integrate other plugins into the 'medal goals'
section.

just copy/move the file to the plugin folder and rename it to e_rank.php.
For example: the file faq.php should be copied to:  e107_plugins/faq/e_rank.php
You may also use them as example files for other plugins, but need to adjust the code to fit that plugin.


The file mercenary.php gives an example of an 'easy' plugin, where you just want to use 1 specific field
out of a table.
The file faq.php gives a more enhanced example, where you want to use a specific query to retrieve a value.

You may also have a look at the e_rank.php file of the Rank System plugin itself.
It gives an example of how to define more goals for 1 plugin

e107Slider Plugin
=================

Introduction
------------

The e107Slider Plugin is a lightweight responsive slider built 
using ResponsiveSlides.js. The plugin has 2 menus, an image slider 
and a news slider.

ResponsiveSlides.js is a tiny jQuery plugin that creates a 
responsive slider using list items inside <ul>. It works with wide 
range of browsers including all IE versions from IE6 and up. It 
also adds css max-width support for IE6 and other browsers that 
don't natively support it. Its only dependency is that all the 
images are the same size.

The biggest difference to other responsive slider plugins is the 
file size (1kb minified and gzipped).

Instructions
------------

*Image Slider

The Image Slider Menu displays image slides and an optional caption, 
slides can also be given a link. The menu has a number of settings 
which can be configured in the Image Slider settings page.

Add images to e107_plugins/e107slider/slides/ then choose which image 
to use when you 'Add a Slide'. Each image must be the same size. You 
can add an optional caption or create a link for each slide. Captions 
can contain HTML.

*News Slider

The News Slider Menu will display your latest news posts images and 
headline in a responsive slider. The slides are generated from the 
news items image which is set when you create a news item. Each image 
must be the same size. You can choose how many posts to display in the 
News Slider settings page.

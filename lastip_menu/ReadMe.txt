FOR v0.7+ ONLY!

Change 0.5
- FIXED, maybe ;) bug with date, now date is calculated according user's timezone.
  Server must be GMT 0, or you must adjust a suitable timezone from your profile.
- FIXED bug with records list.
- FIXED another bug with records list.
- ADDED ability to delete records from the custom table.

1. Installation

  1) UnZIP
  2) Put unzipped 'lastip_menu' folder in 'e107_plugins/'
  3) Install as plugin for e107
  5) Activate menu ( required for plugin to work! )

Activated menu will not show, but don't worry,
it's there and writes user's ip into db.

-----
2. Configuration

All options may be found in the admin section of e107.
For full functionality, choose 'Custom' table (default).

Some options are not shown, depending on selected table.

Enjoy!

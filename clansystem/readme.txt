Purpose:
	This is a plugin for the e107 content management system,
	designed to provide a complete clan management system for 
	online gaming clans.

Requirements:
	e107 v0.7+

Special Notes:
	This is a snapshot release of the current development code for the project. 
	The snapshot is only intended to allow the public to see the current status
	of the project at time of snapshot. 
	
	As of this snapshot, join requests to the clan and role permissions are 
	partially completed and nothing else.
	
	Join requests by users can be made, and clan members can post comments and
	make a decision on the application per their permission level. The requester
	can view public comments and the status of their application.
	
	Permissions and roles are fully editable and are linked directly to 
	User Classes in e107.
	
	In order to see how the join request system works, you must first send
	a request yourself, and then approve the application. After that, you'll
	have access to other requests as they come in.

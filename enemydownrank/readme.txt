FAQ:

Q. How do I find out my ladder id ?
A. When you are on main page of the ladder, the address will have ladder.php?ladder=YOURLADDERID in it.

A. When you goto your clan information page on ED, the address will have clan.php?id=YOURCLANID in it.

Q. Our clan has just gone up/down a place, but the menu still shows the old ranking ?
A. The menu refreshes roughy every 10 minutes, so wait or click update in the enemy down rank admin.

Q. Why is it saying "OFFLINE" ?
A. The webserver cannot contact the Enemy Down site, this usually means ED is offline for maintenaince.

Q. Why is it saying "UPDATE" ?
A. Usually because the clan has changed ladders and you need to put in the new ladder ID.
A. It also happens when Enemy Down change the ranking format, and a plugin update is needed.

Q. How can I customise the design or layout ?
A. Edit enemydownrank_menu.php and find "STYLE CUSTOMISED HERE" but some HTML/PHP knowledge needed.

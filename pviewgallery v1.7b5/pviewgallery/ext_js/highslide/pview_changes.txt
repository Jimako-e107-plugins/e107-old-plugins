Changes to make highslide compatible to PViewGallery and e107.

e_meta.php:
- included a js languagefile. this script sets all labels (array hs.lang)
- if languagefile not exists: english will used
- included all scriptfiles and CSS files

highslide.config.js:
- set groups for different cases (gallery, menus, search results, profile page)
- moved language settings to a seperate language file

highslide.css:
.highslide img {
	/*border: 1px solid #D0D0D0; pview*/
	border: none;
}

All scripts are unchanged. Using highslide-full.js!

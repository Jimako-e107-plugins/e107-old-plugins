##Agenda is a calendar, appointment and event organiser.

Agenda is configurable from the Admin area of e107. Many aspects of Agenda can be configured, from who can add and maintain entries to styles used for drawing calendar views to managing types and categories - plus much more.

Use normal e107 plugin installation procedures to install Agenda:
Back up your e107_agenda_
tables first (just in case)
Upload plugin, overwriting existing files
Update from Plugin manager


Post install, run a Database Validity Check and fix any issues. I have seen some problems where databases were out of sync but not 100% sure why (maybe incorrect upgrade path). Anyway, this step should fix any issues you may have.

Please report any bugs and feature requests at my bugtracker

This roster system is loosely based upon the milpacs system designed for phpnuke and phpnuke evo. This roster system took over 300 hours 
to get to the state that it is in now.

HOW TO INSTALL

Upload all files within the "roster" folder to your e107_Plugins directory.
Go to your plugin manager and install "Roster by Carl Taylor"
Once installed you may configure the settings by clicking the configure button.

HOW TO USE

You must create a GROUP, otherwise any user that you create will not show up. 
You must then create the users profile, and although not every area needs to be filled in, it certainly is helpful.

You are able to edit all GROUPS, and USERS once they have been created.

HOW TO ADD THE SITE LINKS

The Roster link is added by default.

IMAGE FORMAT

All images are set to work from .png format, this is to minimise the space used on your server, and the loading times on the pages.

Profile images should be placed in the "images\directory" folder. Uniform images are done by the number of the person on the roster. 

For example the first person in the roster is JBloggs, and his number on the roster is 1, and his userprofile is 1, and as such the uniform image should be 1.png to coincide with his userprofile.

# V2 To do

- Convert LAN files (inclunding filenames and paths) to V2 standards
- Enable image (or images) in definitons. Needs to be made a custom media manager categorie (in plugin.xml) and a database field...
- Change the user field. Change the old v1 (1.NAME) to V2 (1 - user id only) and use USER core functions to retrieve username...
- Allow templating of the initials buttons form (used as filter when browsing definitions)
- Allow definition to be rendered as several options: as a link, as a link AND tooltip, as a tooltip only.
  - Enable to show link in tooltip or no...
- Code cleanup:
  - Delete unused functions / methods
  - Use traits for commonly used functions (like the category select in admin area...), instead of classes...
  - Reuse the admin_config code to render the frontend edit / create definition form, maybe?
  - Check files / classes redundancy and overhead...
